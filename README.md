# The-Freebird-App

- The project focuses on creating a web application to provide effective assistance to people who want to sell or buy particular services by searching and applying more conveniently and easily. The built job recommendation balances work intensity of people as it promotes time management and flexibility.

- The main aim of this project is to help the people who are in a situation where they couldnâ€™t get a chance to work even though they are well educated, or when they are skilled at one specific task, or when a person wishes to work independently, or when a client needs a specific task to be done and many more reasons.

- The pandemic has made it more tough to find a job and earn a living. Thus, the application gives users an easy access to sell all their services and at the same time clients can accept, post and delete their requests according to availability of services and their respective needs. With that the job recommendation system deficiates the time consumed by the customers by giving them proper postings and information lists.

- The application looks like this in the end:
